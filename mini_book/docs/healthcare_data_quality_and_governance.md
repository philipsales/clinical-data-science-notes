# Healthcare Data Quality and Governance #

## I. Why Data Quality Matters ##

### 4 Aspects of Operational Data Quality
1. **Accurate**
    - correct patient
    - correct care
    - accurate patient history
    - avoid mistakes
        - wrong procedure, drug, person, etc.
    - clearly stated information
    - problem
        - create duplicate work
        - makes care more difficult
        - wrong or harmful care
1. **Completeness**
    - record all important events
    - what has been done
    - what has not been done
    - at any time in patient care
    - accurately bill for care
    - no missing care/billing events
    - problem
        - create safety issue
        - risk over or under-medicating
        - gaps in understanding patient's course of care
1. **Timeliness** 
    - record care in a timely manner
    - problem
        - cannot make informed decisions
1. **Auditability** 
    - ensure nothing is missed
    - see what care has been given
    - have a record of who did what
    - ensure patient privacy
    - avoid malpractice
    - allows approve and disprove events
    
### 4 Kind of Uses for Healthcare Data    
1. Billing information
1. Tracking patient care
1. Tracking prescription
1. Operational business

### Aggregate Analysis
1. Trendspotting
1. Low-risk decisions
    
### Data Quality Requirement
1. Low
    - low risk decisions
        - counting admissions
        - restocking inventory
1. Medium 
    - operational
        - financial planning
        - scheduling and staffing
        - workflow
        - workload balancing

1. Highest
    - performance measurement, appraisal, and compensation
    - legally mandated reports
    - scientific studies
        - statistical validty
        - reproducible
        
## II. Measuring Data Quality ##

### Metadata
- Description
    - information about the data
        - format
        - storage
        - data type
        - additional fields
        - range of expected values
    - answers the following
        - who collected?
        - where it was collected?
        - when it was entered?
        - what time it was collected?
    - defines contents of data fields
    - describe data schema
    - data dictionaires describe metadata
    - schema
    - compliance with data standards
    - versioning
    - automatically recorded/generated
  
### **Data Provenance** / **Data Lineage**
- ***`core of data quality`***
- description
    - historic record of data and its origins
        - input
        - entries
        - systems
        - processes
    - record of how data move thru the systems
    - record of what happens to the data
        - full lifecycle
            - creation
            - transformation
        - data pipeline
        
### 5 Components of Data Quality ###
1. **Completeness**
    - missing data  provides incomplete picture
    - causes of incomplete data
    - indication of the following:
        - failed to capture events
        - data is inaccessible
        - time lags in flow of data from system to system
1. **Correctness**
    - answers the following:
        - was data collected reliably?
        - does it matchethe expected values/ranges in real world samples?
        - was it an accurate measure?
        - was it recorded accurately?
1. **Concordance**
    - answers the following:
        - does it match common definition for the purpose it was recorded?
        - can data from different systems or times be compared?
        - does data match similar data collected elsewhere?
1. **Plausibility**
    - answers the following:
        - does the data make sense?
        - is the data what one would expect in a typical situations?
        - does the data contradictory or anomalies from real world samples?
1. **Currency**
    - answers the following:
        - is the data relevant to the timeframe we are studying?
        - do you have data elements that are collected at different times?
        - has the data that has been recorded for the time that is meaningful?

### **Data Validation Methods**
- description
    - checking the accuracy of data sources before using, importing, and processing
    - a form of `data cleansing`
    - validation vs verification deals with issues of
        1. Conformance
        1. Completeness
        1. Plausibility
- answers the following
    - does the data conform to standards?
    - are data values present and complete?
    - are present data values plausible?
    
### Validation vs. Verification
| | Validation | Verfication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| description | alignment of data with values and standards reflected in external benchmarks | how data values match our understanding of local practice |
| scope | standard | internal and local |
| focus | how data fits broader sense | relates data of what we already know |

### 4 Commmon Data Validation Methods
1. **Benchmarking**
    - referencing to existing literature or ground truth data
    - answers the following
        - does the data reflect normal ranges
1. **Data Characterization**

        - what processes are the data exposed to?
        - how does data move between systems?
        - how are the systems connected?
1. **Applying statistical method**

## IV. Sustaining Data Quality through Governance ##

### Data Governance Definition
- description
    - the practice of managing data assets through their lifecycle to ensure they meet organizational quality and data integrity standards
    - geared towards making sure that others can trust their data which is especially important when making patient care decisions
- essentials
    - agreements, policies, and procedures
        1. who collects data
        1. who uses data
        1. how data is used
        1. why data is used
        1. reuse of data
            - train artificial intelligence
            - same research reproducibility
        1. how data is validated
- **`Why data governance matters?`** 
    - recognizes data's value
    - identifies who's responsible for describing the value
    - creates policies and procedures
    - monitors and protects value as data is created and monitored
    - defines who owns data
        - group of people who make up the rules how data should be collected
    - determines legal and ethical consideration
    - directs the terminlogy
    - assigning meaning to measures
    - governance adds clarity
    - provide context to what data means
    - improves communication
    - improves consistency
    - creates consensus among stakeholders
    - data for patient care
        - billing transactions represent patient care
        - capturing care elements add value to data
        - allows broader use of data
        
- **`Data Context`**
    - governance adds clarity
        - use of context
        - unit of measure
        - meanings for different audience
        - e.g. `duration of patient stay` differs among different stakeholder
        
| Role | Description | Unit of Measure|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Administrator | Occupancy Rate | Day |
| Infection Control | Measure of Risk infection | Hours and Minutes |

- **`Data Stewards`**
