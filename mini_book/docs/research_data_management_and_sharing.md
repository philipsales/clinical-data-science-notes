## I. Understanding Research Data ##
    
### Data Management ###
- Definition
    - activities/practices that support `long-term preservation, access, and use` of data
- Purpose
    - sustains the value of data
    - required by other funding institutions
        - for reuse, secondary analysis, replication
        - for verification and refinement of published results
        - to promote new research
        - reduce potential scientific fraud
        - provide resources for traning new research
        - for transparency and openness
            - discoverable
            - accessible
            - reusable
        - for return investments
        - reduces unintentional redundancies
- Funder requirements
    1. National Science Foundation (NSF)
        - 2 pager supplementary document
        1. types of data to be produced
        1. data and metadata format and content
        1. policies for access and sharing, security provisions
        1. policies for dissemination and re-use
        1. plans for archiving, preserving, and providing access to the data
    1. National Institute of Health (NIH)
        1. final dataset format
        1. documentation
        1. analytic tools used
        1. data sharing agreement
        1. how and when data will be accessible
        
- Key takewaways 
    - Data should be valid, shared, and are heterogeneous and contextualized within research communities.
    - Without supporting documentation and metadata, data may be rendered meaningless and unusable.
    - Proper data management takes place across the entire research data lifecycle!
- Activities 
    1. Planning
    1. Documenting
    1. Formatting
    1. Storing
    1. Cleaning and Anonymizing
    1. Controlling access
- Stakeholders
    1. Primary Researchers
        1. Principal investigator
        1. Graduate students
    1. Institutions
    1. Data Repositories
    1. Data Creators
    1. Secondary Users/Third-party
        - pharmaceuticals
    1. Funders
    1. Publishers and Journal


### Research Data Lifecycle ###
1. Discovery and Planning
    - determine type and format
    - consider privacy policy, confidentialy, and ethical issues
    - consider types of documentation and metadata
    - identify users of project data
    - identify appropriate data repository
    - determine data management cost
        1. Planning
        1. Documenting
        1. Formatting
        1. Storing
        1. Cleaning and Anonymizing
        1. Controlling access
1. Initial Data Collection
    - comply with best practices
        - file organization
            - file formatting
            - naming convention
            - versioning policies
        - backup & storage strategies
        - quality assurance protocol
1. Data Preparation and Analysis
    - clean, manipulate, process data
    - creating master version to be analyzed and archived
        - final version as read-only
    - document any changes
    - document analysis procedure
        - additional modification
        - code used to run analysis
        - model used
1. Publication and Sharing
    - prepare data files and other research materials for future reuse
    - ensure regulatory compliance
        - file format
        - repository specification
        - privacy requirements
    - review documentation and apply metadata
1. Long Term Management
    - safely stored
    - key repository functions
        - ensure integrity of data
        - protect against data loss
        - provide access to data
